Notes about websites
www.publicis.com
The structure is interesting, it switches from 4 to 6 to 1 column. 
the space is positive fill with images or large text and the negative one is just white, the colors are either red or white
Balance - It manages to self adjust and mostly everything seems to be very balanced, all into squares
Size, the logo is the least important thing, so the size is not that important, but the images are the ones that rules the space
At the beginning above the fold is nice, but then the font size seems too small mostly in small screens

It is a great way to present a lot of information, 
it works better in mobile than in the website, 
it could use the negative space to present more information, the padding apparently is too much. In some sections, having a more balanced use of the menu, will help find the way back to what you were looking

Comparison
Hero image in one and different images in the other, the first one is showing of, the second one is inviting you to click. something interesting about both is that the experience is very different and more atttractive in mobile than in the website
